# My First Object-Oriented Java Code

I'm thrilled to share my first object-oriented Java code! ðŸŽ‰

## Description
In this project, I have implemented a simple object-oriented program using Java. It demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, and encapsulation.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Approach:** The code is structured using classes and objects to model real-world entities and interactions.
- **Encapsulation:** The program utilizes encapsulation to hide internal implementation details and provide a clean interface.

## Usage
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the Java file using your preferred Java development environment.
3. Enjoy exploring my first object-oriented Java code!

## Conclusion
Creating my first object-oriented Java code has been an exciting journey. I'm delighted to dive deeper into the world of object-oriented programming and continue building more sophisticated applications.

Feel free to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
